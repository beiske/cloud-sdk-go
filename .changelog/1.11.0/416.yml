title: Fixed NewUpdateRequest for deployments with autoscaling enabled
description: |
    Requests generated by NewUpdateRequest used to only contain topology elements with size > 0. 
    However for deployments with autoscaling enabled, all elements must be included. With this fix the generated
    request will contain all topology elements for Elasticsearch as defined by the deployment template.
