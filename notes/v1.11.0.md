# Changelog

This release of the Elastic Cloud SDK Go should be used for ECE Version `3.4.0`.

## Enhancements

### Update API spec to ECE 3.4.0 / ESS ms-78 ([#408](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/issues/408))

Updates the ECE generated Clients and models to the latest version.

## Bug fixes

### Fixed NewUpdateRequest for deployments with autoscaling enabled ([#416](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/issues/416))

Requests generated by NewUpdateRequest used to only contain topology elements with size > 0. 
However for deployments with autoscaling enabled, all elements must be included. With this fix the generated
request will contain all topology elements for Elasticsearch as defined by the deployment template.
